**To-Do List Repository Description**
Project Overview: This "To-Do List" application is a simple yet efficient tool designed to help users manage their tasks and stay organized. The app allows users to add, edit, mark as completed, and delete tasks with ease. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a fully functional, interactive user interface.

**Technologies Used:**
HTML: This is the foundation of the app's structure. It provides the necessary elements such as input fields, buttons, and task lists to create a user-friendly layout.
CSS: Styling for the app is handled with CSS, ensuring the interface is both visually appealing and responsive. The app adjusts well on different screen sizes and features a clean, modern design with subtle animations for task interactions.
JavaScript: JavaScript brings interactivity to the app. It enables the core functionality such as adding, editing, and deleting tasks, as well as marking them as completed. The app uses JavaScript to dynamically update the task list and store the user's tasks in the browser’s local storage, making sure tasks persist even after a page refresh.

**Features:**
Add New Tasks:
Users can add new tasks by typing in the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
Each task is displayed in the task list below, along with options to edit or delete the task.

**Edit Existing Tasks:**
Users can click on a task to edit its text. After editing, they can press "Save" to update the task.
Mark Tasks as Completed:
Each task has a checkbox to mark it as completed. When a task is marked, it will be visually crossed out, providing a clear distinction between completed and pending tasks.
Delete Tasks:
Tasks can be easily removed by clicking the "Delete" button next to them.

**Persistence (Local Storage):**
The app uses the browser’s localStorage to save tasks. This means that even if the page is refreshed, users’ tasks will remain saved until they manually delete them.
